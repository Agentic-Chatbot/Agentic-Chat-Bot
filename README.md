# AGENTIC CHATBOT 

We are building an Agentic Chatbot for the Robotics Club to act as an intelligent assistant. It will answer technical 
questions, retrieve documents from Google Drive, send automated emails, assist with event registrations via Google 
Forms, provide reminders, track tasks, evaluate skills, conduct events, and generate data-driven results.
